<p>My story is about a greatsword wielding warrior and the decisions he makes in his travels while defending the free peoples of the land. His name is Arneithan.</p>
<p>I chose this story because it somewhat relates to my life. No, I'm not a greatsword wielding warrior, but I did play one for several years in the game The Lord of the Rings Online. His name was, you guessed it, Arneithan. All my friends called me Arne, and some still do to this day. I've never been a role player, so this is about as far as I've ever gone with it.</p>
